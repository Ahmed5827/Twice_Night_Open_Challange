# Twice_Night_Open_Challenge (Quit Smoking AI App)

## Overview
The Quit Smoking AI App is designed to help users quit smoking by leveraging AI-driven insights and personalized recommendations. The app predicts when the user is likely to smoke their next cigarette and sends notifications to discourage smoking while suggesting alternative activities to manage triggers. Additionally, the app provides daily motivational quotes to keep users engaged in their journey to quit smoking.
